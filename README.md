Hi 👋 My name is Tim Starbuck
=============================

Fullstack Developer
-------------------

Y2K was the impetus to get me going on the path of a developer. I've worked for large companies in the past, currently working for a non-profit and enjoying the culture of doing good work for the community. Consider myself a full-stack developer working primary with dotnet and nodejs/javascript.

*   🌍  I'm based in Nebraska, USA
